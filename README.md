# OpenCLGameOfLife

This is a simple, bare-bones implementation of the popular zero player game Conway's Game of Life.
You can play with the input parameters on the first cell of the notebook: L is a list of ordered pairs that describes
which cells are alive in the first generation, N is the size of the cell matrix and K is the number of
iterations to be computed. The final result will show as an animation on the last cell of the notebook.
